# Weather Dashboard
The weather dashboard was built to provide instant access to the weather outlook in any city. Get the current 
weather as well as the five day forecast by simply searching the city you are interested in.

## How it Works

### Search a city to Get the Current Weather and Five Day Forecast
Search a city name using the form in the left column. 
* You will be provided with the current:
  * Temperature
  * Humidity 
  * Wind speed 
  * Icon representation of the conditions
  * A colour coded UV index representing the severity of the conditions. 
 
* You will also be provided with a five day forecast of future conditions including: 
  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Icon representation of the conditions

### Search History
Every city you search will be saved to the search history in the left column. Clicking the city name in the search history will present
you with its weather conditions again. The search history list will persist upon refresh or re-visiting the page at a later time. Click
the clear history button to clear the list.
